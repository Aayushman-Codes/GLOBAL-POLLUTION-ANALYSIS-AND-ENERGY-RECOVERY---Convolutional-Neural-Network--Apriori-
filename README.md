# GLOBAL-POLLUTION-ANALYSIS-AND-ENERGY-RECOVERY---Convolutional Neural Network (Apriori Algorithm)
**Global Pollution Analysis and Energy Recovery using Convolutional Neural Network (Apriori Algorithm)**

This model was built on Kaggle Notebook since the code might not work on Jupyter Notebook due to version diferences or the use of Jupyter Web (which isnt the problem with Kaggle Notebook). The main source code utilises Machine Learning Algorithms specified to give the required output (included with the code itself).

**To run the model:**

1) Open Kaggle.

2) Create a new Notebook.

3) Copy and paste the source code from this project into your new notebook.

4) Run the notebook to see the output.

**Model Summary**

Type of Model: Convolutional Neural Network (Apriori Algorithm)

Objective: The goal of this project is to analyze global pollution data to understand the relationship between pollution levels (air, water, soil) and energy recovery across different countries. By leveraging the Apriori algorithm, we aim to uncover hidden associations between pollution factors and energy consumption that can guide strategies for pollution control and energy optimization. This dataset will be used for Apriori Algorithm and evaluation/validation techniques.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
